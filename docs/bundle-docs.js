Rather use the\n`renderFunc` prop to print SVGs on the go.\n\nThe source code below assumes that you have the SVG from [here](https://github.com/fontIconPicker/react-fonticonpicker/blob/master/src/docs/assets/superhero.svg)\nprinted directly after the opening `<body>` of your HTML.\n\nNotice we return JSX or React Element from the function.\n\n```js\nconst renderSVG = svg => (\n\t<svg>\n\t\t<use xlinkHref={`#${svg}`} />\n\t</svg>\n);\nconst MyComponent = () => {\n\treturn (\n\t\t<FontIconPicker\n\t\t\ticons={iconDefs.svgs}\n\t\t\tvalue={['004-green_lantern', '066-daredevil_glasses']}\n\t\t\tonChange={val => val}\n\t\t\trenderFunc={renderSVG}\n\t\t\ttheme=\"indigo\"\n\t\t\tisMulti\n\t\t/>\n\t);\n}\nexport default MyComponent;\n```\n"},135:function(e,a){e.exports="### 4: Attribute Rendering\n\nBy default `FontIconPicker` sets `convertHex` to `true`. We need that because\nthe icon values are not in unicode, rather its decimal value. Internally `FontIconPicker`\nwill convert the decimal values to string code at that value. For this we use `String.fromCodePoint`.\n\nSince we pass only `numbers` with `icons`, we also pass an additional `search`\nprop to use the search field effectively.\n\n```js\nconst MyComponent = () => {\n\tconst icons = [\n\t\t57436,\n\t\t57437,\n\t\t57438,\n\t\t57439,\n\t\t57524,\n\t\t57525,\n\t\t57526,\n\t\t57527,\n\t];\n\tconst search = [\n\t\t'Box add',\n\t\t'Box remove',\n\t\t'Download',\n\t\t'Upload',\n\t\t'List',\n\t\t'List 2',\n\t\t'Numbered list',\n\t\t'Menu',\n\t];\n\treturn (\n\t\t<FontIconPicker\n\t\t\ticons={icons}\n\t\t\tsearch={search}\n\t\t\tvalue={[57436, 57437]}\n\t\t\tonChange={(val) => console.log(val)}\n\t\t\tisMulti\n\t\t\trenderUsing=\"data-icomoon\"\n\t\t\tconvertHex={true} // this isn't needed\n\t\t/>\n\t);\n}\nexport default MyComponent;\n```\n"},136:function(e,a){e.exports="### 3: Single and Multi Picker\n\nThe source codes below were used for populating the examples.

It can\nbe an `array` for non-categorized picker or an `plain object` for categorized\nicon picker.\n\n### Required Props\n\n`FontIconPicker` requires only three props.\n\n1. `icons`: Source of icons, could be an array or an object.\n2. `onChange`: Function to call on value change.\n3. `value`: Initial value. Should be an array for multi type or a string or number for single type.\n\nBy default, `FontIconPicker` tries to render using `class`. So whatever you pass\nthrough `icons`, will be used like `<i class={icon}>`. This works good with\nfontawesome, icomoon etc. For some reason, if you want to use a custom attribute\nand convert the values to `hex`, then follow the examples.\n\nAlso, `FontIconPicker` defaults to `isMulti` to `true`. So it provides you an\ninterface to pick multiple icons. Also it expects the `value` to be an `array`.\nYou can disable this by passing `isMulti={false}`.\n"},14:function(e,a,t){"use

help of [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).\n\nFirst fork and git clone the repo on your machine.\n\n```bash\ngit clone git@github.com:<username>/react-fonticonpicker.git\n```\n\nNow install all the dependencies. Make sure you have [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)\nversion 9 or higher.\n\n```bash\nnpm install\n```\n\nNow run the server with\n\n```bash\nnpm start\n```\n\nThis will open a webpack dev server with hot reload. You can access the server\nfrom [http://localhost:7770](http://localhost:7770).\n\nNow make changes in the component and see it live. Also add unit tests and\nintegration tests where applicable.\n\nIf your changes invalidates snapshots, then make sure to update them too (with\ngood reasons).\n\nWhen doing a PR, try not to build the docs or the dist. It will create unnecessary\nmerge conflict.\n\nOther npm commands at disposal:\n\n* `npm run test`: Runs `eslint` followed by `stylelint` and `jest` tests.\n* `npm run start`: Runs a dev server with hot reload.\n* `npm run docs`: Builds the docs for production.\n* `npm run build`: Builds the UMD & CSS files for distribution.\n\n## Credits\n\nReact FontIconPicker has been developed by [Swashata](https://swashata.me) mainly for in use with [eForm](https://eform.live).\nThe original idea came from [jQuery FontIconPicker](https://github.com/fontIconPicker/fontIconPicker)\nby [Alessandro Benoit](http://codeb.it).\n\nNone of these would have been possible without the cool [Wes Bos 🔥](https://wesbos.com/)\nand his [react for beginners course](https://reactforbeginners.com/).

For example, in your application\'s main `scss` file:\n\n```scss\n@import \'./node_modules/@fonticonpicker/react-fonticonpicker/dist/fonticonpicker.base-theme.react.css\';\n@import \'./node_modules/@fonticonpicker/react-fonticonpicker/dist/fonticonpicker.material-theme.react.css\';\n```\n\nOr if you want to use the style files directly:\n\n```html\n<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="screen"  href="./node_modules/@fonticonpicker/react-fonticonpicker/dist/fonticonpicker.base-theme.react.css" />\n<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="screen"  href="./node_modules/@fonticonpicker/react-fonticonpicker/dist/fonticonpicker.material-theme.react.css" />\n```\n\nAs you have noticed, there are two CSS files required:\n\n1. `base-theme`: Includes the basic layout style for fonticonpicker to work.\n   It does not have any coloring or theming.\n2. `material-theme`: Includes theming for all the styles in this demo.\n\n### Use with CDN\n\nFor some reason, if you\'d prefer the CDN, then it is available at [unpkg.com](https://unpkg.com/@fonticonpicker/react-fonticonpicker/dist/).\n\nPlace them in your HTML document, along with UMD builds of peer dependencies.\n\n```html\n\x3c!-- Styles --\x3e\n<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="screen" href="https://unpkg.com/@fonticonpicker/react-fonticonpicker/dist/fonticonpicker.base-theme.react.css" />\n<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="screen" href="https://unpkg.com/@fonticonpicker/react-fonticonpicker/dist/fonticonpicker.material-theme.react.css" />\n\x3c!-- Scripts --\x3e\n<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@16/umd/react.development.js"><\/script>\n<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16/umd/react-dom.development.js"><\/script>\n<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/classnames@2.2.5/index.js"><\/script>\n<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/prop-types@15.6.1/prop-types.min.js"><\/script>\n<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-transition-group@2.3.0/dist/react-transition-group.min.js"><\/script>\n<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/@fonticonpicker/react-fonticonpicker/dist/fonticonpicker.react.js"><\/script>\n```\n\n### Download Source\n\nWe distribute production version of source file through [github releases](https://github.com/fontIconPicker/react-fonticonpicker/releases). Head over there\nand download `fonticonpicker.react.zip` file.\n\nNow extract the zip and use the source as you would use from CDN.\n'},82:function(e,a,t){"use strict";Object.defineProperty(a,"__esModule",{value:!0}),a.default=void 0;var n=l(t(1)),r=l(t(10)),f=l(t(81)),o=l(t(9)),s=l(t(42));function l(e){return e&&e.__esModule?e:{default:e}}a.default=function(){return n.default.createElement("div",{className:"fip-install"},n.default.createElement(r.default,{source:f.default,escapeHtml:!0,renderers:{code:o.default}}),n.default.createElement("h3",null,"peerDependencies"),n.default.createElement("p",null,"FontIconPicker has the following dependencies."),n.default.createElement("div",{className:"list-group"},Object.keys(s.default.peerDependencies).map(function(e){return n.default.createElement("a",{key:e,href:"https://www.npmjs.com/package/".concat(e),className:"list-group-item d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center"},n.default.createElement("code",null,e),n.default.createElement("span",{className:"badge badge-primary badge-pill"},s.default.peerDependencies[e]))})))}},83:function(e,a,t){"use strict";Object.defineProperty(a,"__esModule",{value:!0}),a.default=void 0;var n=s(t(1)),r=t(8),f=s(t(16)),o=function(e){if(e&&e.__esModule)return e;var a={};if(null!=e)for(var t in e)if(Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(e,t)){var n=Object.defineProperty&&Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor?Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(e,t):{};n.get||n.set?Object.defineProperty(a,t,n):a[t]=e[t]}return a.default=e,a}(t(14));function s(e){return e&&e.__esModule?e:{default:e}}function l(e){return(l="function"==typeof Symbol&&"symbol"==typeof Symbol.iterator?function(e){return typeof e}:function(e){return e&&"function"==typeof Symbol&&e.constructor===Symbol&&e!==Symbol.prototype?"symbol":typeof e})(e)}function i(e,a){for(var t=0;t<a.length;t++){var n=a[t];n.enumerable=n.enumerable||!1,n.configurable=!0,"value"in n&&(n.writable=!0),Object.defineProperty(e,n.key,n)}}function c(e,a){return!a||"object"!==l(a)&&"function"!=typeof a?u(e):a}function u(e){if(void 0===e)throw new ReferenceError("this hasn't been initialised - super() hasn't been called");return e}var d=function(e){function a(){var e,t,r;!function(e,a){if(!(e instanceof a))throw new TypeError("Cannot call a class as a function")}(this,a);for(var f=arguments.length,o=new Array(f),s=0;s<f;s++)o[s]=arguments[s];return c(r,(t=r=c(this,(e=a.__proto__||Object.getPrototypeOf(a)).call.apply(e,[this].concat(o))),Object.defineProperty(u(r),"state",{configurable:!0,enumerable:!0,writable:!0,value:{value1:57436,value2:[],value3:57595,value4:[57475,57476,57477,57539,57662,57404,57405,57408]}}),Object.defineProperty(u(r),"handleChange",{configurable:!0,enumerable:!0,writable:!0,value:function(e,a){var t=Array.isArray(a)?function(e){return function(e){if(Array.isArray(e)){for(var a=0,t=new Array(e.length);a<e.length;a++)t[a]=e[a];return t}}(e)||function(e){if(Symbol.iterator in Object(e)||"[object Arguments]"===Object.prototype.toString.call(e))return Array.from(e)}(e)||function(){throw new TypeError("Invalid attempt to spread non-iterable instance")}()}(a):a;r.setState(function(e,a,t){return a in e?Object.defineProperty(e,a,{value:t,enumerable:!0,configurable:!0,writable:!0}):e[a]=t,e}({},e,t))}}),Object.defineProperty(u(r),"renderSVG",{configurable:!0,enumerable:!0,writable:!0,value:function(e){return n.default.createElement("svg",null,n.default.createElement("use",{xlinkHref:"#".concat(e)}))}}),t))}var t,s;return function(e,a){if("function"!=typeof a&&null!==a)throw new TypeError("Super expression must either be null or a function");e.prototype=Object.create(a&&a.prototype,{constructor:{value:e,enumerable:!1,writable:!0,configurable:!0}}),a&&(Object.setPrototypeOf?Object.setPrototypeOf(e,a):e.__proto__=a)}(a,n.default.PureComponent),t=a,(s=[{key:"render",value:function(){var e=this;return n.default.createElement(n.default.Fragment,null,n.default.createElement("h2",null,"Examples and Few Use Cases"),n.default.createElement("p",null,"Here you will find plenty of examples and use cases."),n.default.createElement("p",null,"You can get the full source code"," ",n.default.createElement("a",{href:"https://github.com/fontIconPicker/react-fonticonpicker/blob/master/src/docs/components/pages/Examples.jsx"},"here"),"."),n.default.createElement("ul",{className:"list-group"},n.default.createElement("li",{className:"list-group-item list-group-item-action flex-column align-items-start"},n.default.createElement("div",{className:"d-flex w-100 justify-content-between"},n.default.createElement("h5",{className:"mb-1"},"Append to Body & Single Picker"),n.default.createElement("small",null,n.default.createElement("code",null,"isMulti=","{false}"," ",'appendTo="body"'))),n.default.createElement("p",{className:"mb-1"},"The picker element uses"," ",n.default.createElement("code",null,'appendTo="body"')," to append the protal to body.
